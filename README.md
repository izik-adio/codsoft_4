# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game in Python. The game allows users to play against the computer, keeping track of scores across multiple rounds.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/izik-adio/codsoft_4.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd codsoft_4
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
5. The computer will randomly select its choice.
6. The winner of each round is determined based on the game rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
7. Continue playing until you decide to stop.

Enjoy the game!
